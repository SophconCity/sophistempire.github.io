## Setup and Deployment

This website is designed for deployment via GitHub Pages.

### Prerequisites

* A GitHub account.
* Familiarity with Git commands (basic `add`, `commit`, `push`).
* A Codespace environment (recommended for development and deployment).

### Steps to Deploy/Update

1.  **Repository Setup:**
    * Ensure your GitHub username is `SophistEmpire`.
    * The repository hosting this website **MUST** be named exactly: `SophistEmpire.github.io`.
    * If you renamed your GitHub username or repository, ensure your Codespace's remote URL is updated:
        ```bash
        git remote set-url origin [https://github.com/SophistEmpire/sophistempire.github.io.git](https://github.com/SophistEmpire/sophistempire.github.io.git)
        git pull origin main
        ```

2.  **Clone or Open Codespace:**
    * If starting fresh, create a new Codespace from your `SophistEmpire.github.io` repository on GitHub.
    * If continuing work, open your existing Codespace.

3.  **File Management:**
    * Verify that `index.html` and `style.css` are in the root directory of your repository.
    * Ensure all images (`professional-photo.jpg`, `hero-background.jpg`, and the 8 portfolio thumbnails) are located inside the `images/` folder within your repository's root.

4.  **Commit and Push Changes:**
    * Open the terminal in your Codespace.
    * Add all changes to the staging area:
        ```bash
        git add .
        ```
    * Commit your changes with a descriptive message:
        ```bash
        git commit -m "Updated website content and styling with latest changes"
        ```
    * Push your changes to the GitHub repository:
        ```bash
        git push origin main
        ```

5.  **GitHub Pages Activation (if not already active):**
    * Go to your `SophistEmpire.github.io` repository on GitHub.com.
    * Navigate to **"Settings"** > **"Pages"**.
    * Under "Branch," select `main` (or `master` if that's your primary branch).
    * Under "Folder," select `/ (root)`.
    * Click **"Save."**

Your website will typically be live at `https://SophistEmpire.github.io/` within a few minutes after a successful push.
